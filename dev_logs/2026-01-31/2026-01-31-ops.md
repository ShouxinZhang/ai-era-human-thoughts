# Ops Log - 2026-01-31

## Purpose
Keep production deployment operations auditable and reproducible.

## Timeline (UTC+8, CST)
- 2026-01-31 08:57:28 CST: Installed `acme.sh`.
- 2026-01-31 08:57:49 CST: Generated DNS-01 TXT challenge for `thoughts.wudizhe.com`.
- 2026-01-31 09:00:56 CST: DNS-01 verified; Let’s Encrypt certificate issued.
- 2026-01-31 09:01:08 CST: Installed certificate to Nginx and reloaded.

## Key actions
- HTTPS enabled for `thoughts.wudizhe.com` via manual DNS-01.
- Nginx configured to:
  - Redirect HTTP→HTTPS for `thoughts.wudizhe.com`
  - Reverse-proxy HTTPS traffic to `127.0.0.1:3000`
- Production DB check:
  - `GET /api/entries` initially empty (`data=[]`) due to table being empty
  - `POST /api/entries` verified write path works

## Follow-ups
- Consider automating DNS-01 renewals (AliDNS API) to avoid manual TXT updates.
